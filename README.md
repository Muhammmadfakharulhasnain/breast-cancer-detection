## Breast Cancer Prediction Project

This repository features a machine learning project focused on predicting whether breast tumors are malignant or benign. The objective is to develop and compare various machine learning models to accurately classify tumors based on a range of features.

This rephrased version maintains the original meaning while slightly altering the wording for variety.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, available in the scikit-learn library. This dataset consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize the distribution of target classes.
   - Explore relationships between features and the target variable.
   - Identify correlations between features.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Apply feature selection techniques, such as SelectKBest, to select relevant features.

4. **Model Building**:
   - Build and evaluate various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compare the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the results of model evaluation using charts and plots.

7. **Predictive System**:
   - Implement a predictive system to make predictions on new data using the best-performing model.

## Getting Started

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-classification.git
   ```
   
2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts**:
   - Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook or run the Python scripts in the appropriate order to execute the project steps.

## Results

The project results indicate that the [mention the best-performing model] achieved the highest accuracy of [mention the accuracy score]. Detailed performance metrics for each model are provided in the project documentation.
